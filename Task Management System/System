Structure:

Progress Report (To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
    

To assign tasks to specific teams what I can do is simply:
	1. Create a function that would make a team with the name that we type...
	2. That team would be displayed under the teams section on the side nav-bar...
	3. The task will be displayed under that team's name when we assign it...
	
Task assignment for grouping:
	1. Assign the tasks in categories of different projects, departments, priority levels, due dates, teams and progress...
	2. Each category will contain a link that will lead to the specific category's item which will contain the tasks related to that 		   item...
	3. The tasks will be displayed in the specific category's item...
	4. For priority, the highest priority tasks will be displayed w.r.t due dates, teams and departments while keeping the tasks in the 		   "ALL TASKS" page.
